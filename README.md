# Language_Classification
It's a Natural Language Processing project to Classify among Languages using SciKit Learn in Python.


The working of the code is mentioned along with the code itself in the form of docstrings and comments.
Some Machine Learning theory is required for better understanding of the working of the code.

Basically, the code here takes up two files, one for training and one for validation of the language we're providing.
Then using the CountVectorizer and The Naive Bayes Algorithm, specifically, the Multinomial NB module, which
specializes for application of Bayes theorem with text is used.

I learned and compiled this through a guided project, and I thoroughly enjoyed the working of code when i finally received the 
results of my code.

Some Medium Articles that I suggest before reading the code are:
